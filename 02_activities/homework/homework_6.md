**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my previous roles, I worked with pricing and promotions data for over 300 grocery stores across the USA and Canada. This data was integrated into our systems to display accurate pricing on our website, allowing customers to order online from the nearest grocery store. When pricing discrepancies arose—whether due to system glitches or errors in the retailer-uploaded data—I took immediate action to address the issue. I would block the affected products on our website to prevent customer confusion and promptly inform the retailer about the problem. Together, we would work to rectify the situation, ensuring that the information was corrected without misusing any sensitive data I had access to.

This experience not only reinforced my commitment to ethical data handling but also highlighted the importance of addressing inequality within the data we managed. Pricing disparities can inadvertently affect different demographic groups, particularly in underserved communities. I recognized that some customers might be disproportionately impacted by errors in pricing, leading to potential financial harm or distrust in the system. Therefore, I made it a priority to ensure that our pricing was not only accurate but also equitable.

By implementing rigorous checks and transparent communication with retailers, I aimed to mitigate any negative effects of pricing errors and promote fairness in our offerings. This focus on ethical practices and addressing inequalities ensured that we treated all customers equitably, fostering trust and accessibility in our services.
